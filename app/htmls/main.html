<p>It all started with my antique booth though, and even though I don’t put as much time into that aspect of my business as I used to, I still love hunting down good old junk and helping it find it’s way into new hands.
And along with hunting junk, finding the story behind the stuff makes the experience that much more rich.
Flea market vendors and estate sale workers typically don’t know the stories behind the things they are selling, so when the opportunity to buy directly from the person who owns them presents itself, you have the added adventure of hearing them walk down memory lane as they show you what they have to sell.
And that’s what I just had the pleasure of experiencing.</p>
